Title: Real Estate Listings & Analytics

Introduction:
This project builds a PostgreSQL backend to track property listings, agents, buyers and transactions, and to analyze price trends and high-demand areas.

Abstract:
We modeled entities, ingested mock data, built views for summarization and used window functions to generate trend reports.

Tools Used:
PostgreSQL, pgAdmin/DBeaver, Python (Faker), GitHub

Steps Involved:
1. Schema design and ER diagram
2. Sample data generation and ingestion
3. Analytical views and materialized views
4. Triggers for status updates
5. Queries for ranking and trend analysis

Conclusion:
The system demonstrates normalized DB design, automated operations via triggers, and performant analytics via indexed views and materialized pre-aggregation.
